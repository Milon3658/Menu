Today, apart from a few original features the new exotic design and decor of the restaurant compliments the old building with warm colours, brass and wood features and a stunning collection of chandeliers which have been handcrafted and shipped over from India.In addition to the restaurant and bar, we have two tastefully designed private dining rooms which accommodate up to 60 people standing or 30 for a seated dinner, creating the ideal setting for any corporate dining or celebratory event.'
